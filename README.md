 **Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard **
 Determining the price of a stock is complex; It depends on many things like revenue, profits, losses. company news. public perception, future business, and much more. An essential factor is the company's growth of profit/revenue. If the company reports good profits/revenue, the stock price should increase and if it reports bad profits/revenues the stock price will decrease.

Tesla and GameStop have become very popular stocks, with GameStop being one of the fastest rising and popular stocks of the year. Both have seen tremendous gains and for different reasons. In the course project, we will extract revenue and stock price data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue. This dashboard will not only provide information about the revenue and stock price but will allow us to see if there is a correlation between the two.
