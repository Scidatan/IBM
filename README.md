# Stock Price and Revenue Analysis Dashboard  

## Introduction  
Determining the price of a stock is complex as it depends on multiple factors such as revenue, profits, losses, company news, public perception, future business prospects, and more. One of the essential factors affecting stock price movement is the company's profit and revenue growth. Generally, if a company reports good profits and revenue, the stock price should increase, and if it reports poor financials, the stock price tends to decline.  

In this project, we will analyze the relationship between stock prices and revenue for two popular stocks: **Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME)**. GameStop has been one of the fastest-rising stocks in recent times, while Tesla remains a highly influential stock in the market. The goal of this project is to extract stock price and revenue data for both companies and build an interactive **dashboard** to compare the **stock price vs revenue correlation**.  

## Project Overview  
- Extract **Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) stock price** and **revenue** data.  
- Visualize stock price trends alongside revenue reports.  
- Build an interactive **dashboard** to compare stock price movement with revenue data.  
- Identify potential correlations between stock price and revenue performance.  

## Dataset  
The data for stock prices and revenue will be sourced from **reliable financial APIs** or historical stock market datasets.
